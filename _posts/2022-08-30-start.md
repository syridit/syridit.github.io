<p>Hello. I’m glad that you’re on my site!</p>

<p>This is not my first personal website. I had one of these before when I had no experience with web development. It was all flashy and full of ridiculous plugins. After starting my professional life in the industry, I built this one with minimal design principles.</p>

<p>Let’s see how I built this one. Stuffs I’ve used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jekyll (For building the site)</li>
  <li>Github Pages (For deployment)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-your-build-environment">Setting up your build environment</h2>

<p>First of all, I installed <strong>Jekyll</strong>. Jekyll is a static site generator.</p>

<p>(Read the documentation on the official site for more information. It’s not mandatory)</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Install a full <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation">Ruby development environment</a>.</li>
  <li>Install <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#bundler">bundler</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems">gems</a>.
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem install jekyll bundler
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-to-do-with-jekyll">What to do with Jekyll?</h2>

<p>I used a Jekyll template named <a href="https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU"><em>_PortfolYOU_</em></a>. It’s beautiful and minimal.</p>

<p>I had to change the layouts according to my wishes. It’s not that hard. There’s a really helpful document on how to set up yours using this template. 
Here’s the documentation: <a href="https://youssefraafatnasry.me/portfolYOU/docs/">PortfolYOU Docs</a></p>

<p>Basics of HTML &amp; CSS is required to tinker with the navigation, views etc of the site. Explore on your own, it’s fun.</p>

<p>Some important things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> is the mother configuration of your site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a look at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GemFile</code>. It will be required to deploy the site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always edit and run locally to check the output.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you change the main <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file, you need to serve the site again:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle exec jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Browse to <a href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank">http://localhost:4000</a></p>

<p>If you change any HTML, CSS or Markdown files, Jekyll with reload the site with the changes automatically.</p>

<p>Feel free to knock me to know the details on how to add blog posts, projects etc to a Jekyll site.</p>

<h2 id="deploy-using-github-pages">Deploy using Github Pages</h2>

<p>I used Github Pages as my deployment environment. Basically, I did nothing. To learn more about Github pages watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?=1&amp;v=2MsN8gpT6jY">video</a>.</p>

<p>So it’ll be easier to link the instructions I followed. Very simple and easy to follow.
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">Creating a Github Pages site with Jekyll</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>The repository name should be <strong>USERNAME.github.io</strong>
</li>
  <li>For any other repository, the Github pages URL will be. <strong>USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The site will be deployed at <strong>USERNAME.github.io</strong>. For using a custom domain, read the section below.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-domain">Using a domain</h2>

<p>I bought the domain from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>. Follow the article below on how to link this DNS to your Github pages site.
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages">Linking namecheap domain to Github pages</a></p>

<p>After linking, go to your repository settings. Find the Github pages section and set your domain address in the <em>Custom Domain</em> field.
It might take 20-30 minutes for Github to find the DNS the deploy your site to the set address.</p>
